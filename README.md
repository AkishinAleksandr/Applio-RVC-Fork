## üéØ Improvements of Applio-RVC-Fork Over RVC
*The comparisons are with respect to the original [Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI) repository.*
### f0 Inference Algorithm Overhaul
- Applio features a comprehensive overhaul of the f0 inference algorithm, including:
  - Addition of the pyworld dio f0 method.
  - Alternative method for calculating crepe f0.
  - Introduction of the torchcrepe crepe-tiny model.
  - Customizable crepe_hop_length for the crepe algorithm via both the web GUI and CLI.

### f0 Crepe Pitch Extraction for Training
- Works on paperspace machines but not local MacOS/Windows machines (Potential memory leak).

### Paperspace Integration (Under maintenance, so it cannot be used for the moment.)
- Applio seamlessly integrates with Paperspace, providing the following features:
  - Paperspace argument on infer-web.py (--paperspace) for sharing a Gradio link.
  - A dedicated make file tailored for Paperspace users.

### Access to Tensorboard
- Applio grants easy access to Tensorboard via a Makefile and a Python script.

### CLI Functionality
- Applio introduces command-line interface (CLI) functionality, with the addition of the --is_cli flag in infer-web.py for CLI system usage.

### f0 Hybrid Estimation Method
- Applio offers a novel f0 hybrid estimation method by calculating nanmedian for a specified array of f0 methods, ensuring the best results from multiple methods (CLI exclusive).
- This hybrid estimation method is also available for f0 feature extraction during training.

### UI Changes
#### Inference:
- A complete interface redesign enhances user experience, with notable features such as:
  - Audio recording directly from the interface.
  - Convenient drop-down menus for audio and .index file selection.
  - An advanced settings section with new features like autotune and formant shifting.

#### Training:
- Improved training features include:
  - A total epoch slider now limited to 10,000.
  - Increased save frequency limit to 100.
  - Default recommended options for smoother setup.
  - Better adaptation to high-resolution screens.
  - A drop-down menu for dataset selection.
  - Enhanced saving system options, including Save all files, Save G and D files, and Save model for inference.

#### UVR:
- Applio ensures compatibility with all VR/MDX models for an extended range of possibilities.

#### TTS (Text-to-Speech, New):
- Introducing a new Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature using RVC models.
- Support for multiple languages and Edge-tts/Google-tts.

#### Resources (New):
- Users can now upload models, backups, datasets, and audios from various storage services like Drive, Huggingface, Discord, and more.
- Download audios from YouTube with the ability to automatically separate instrumental and vocals, offering advanced options and UVR support.

#### Extra (New):
- Combine instrumental and vocals with ease, including independent volume control for each track and the option to add effects like reverb, compressor, and noise gate.
- Significant improvements in the processing interface, allowing tasks such as merging models, modifying information, obtaining information, or extracting models effortlessly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Additional Features of This Repository

In addition to the aforementioned improvements, this repository offers the following features:

### Enhanced Tone Leakage Reduction
- Implements tone leakage reduction by replacing source features with training-set features using top1 retrieval. This helps in achieving cleaner audio results.

### Efficient Training
- Provides a seamless and speedy training experience, even on relatively modest graphics cards. The system is optimized for efficient resource utilization.

### Data Efficiency
- Supports training with a small dataset, yielding commendable results, especially with audio clips of at least 10 minutes of low-noise speech.

### Overtraining Detection
- This feature keeps track of the current progress trend and stops the training if no improvement is found after 100 epochs.
  - During the 100 epochs with no improvement, no progress is saved. This allows you to continue training from the best-found epoch.
  - A `.pth` file of the best epoch is saved in the logs folder under `name_[epoch].pth`, and in the weights folder as `name_fittest.pth`. These files are the same.

### Mode Collapse Detection
- This feature restarts training before a mode collapse by lowering the batch size until it can progress past the mode collapse.
  - If a mode collapse is overcome but another one occurs later, it will reset the batch size to its initial setting. This helps maintain training speed when dealing with multiple collapses.

## üìù Todo Tasks
- [ ] **Investigate GPU Detection Issue:** Address the GPU detection problem and ensure proper utilization of Nvidia GPU.
- [ ] **Fix Mode Collapse Prevention Feature:** Refine the mode collapse prevention feature to maintain graph consistency during retraining.
- [ ] **Resolve CUDA Compatibility Issue:** Investigate and resolve the cuFFT error related to CUDA compatibility.
- [ ] **Refactor infer-web.py:** Organize the code of infer-web.py into different files for each tab, enhancing modularity.
- [ ] **Expand UVR Model Options:** Integrate additional UVR models to provide users with more options and flexibility.
- [ ] **Enhance Installation Process:** Improve the system installation process for better user experience and clarity.
- [ ] **Implement Automatic Updates:** Add automatic update functionality to keep the application current with the latest features.
- [ ] **Multilingual Support:** Include more translations for various languages.
- [ ] **Diversify TTS Methods:** Introduce new TTS methods and enhance customization options for a richer user experience.
- [ ] **CLI Improvement:** Enhance the CLI functionality and introduce a pipeline for a more streamlined user experience.
- [ ] **Dependency Updates:** Keep dependencies up-to-date by regularly updating to the latest versions.
- [ ] **Dataset Creation Assistant:** Develop an assistant for creating datasets to simplify and guide users through the process.

## ‚ú® Installation

### Automatic installation (Windows):
To quickly and effortlessly install Applio along with all the necessary models and configurations on Windows, you can use the [install_Applio.bat](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio-RVC-Fork/releases) script available in the releases section.

### Manual installation (Windows/MacOS):
**Note for MacOS Users**: When using `faiss 1.7.2` under MacOS, you may encounter a Segmentation Fault: 11 error. To resolve this issue, install `faiss-cpu 1.7.0` using the following command if you're installing it manually with pip: 
 ```bash
pip install faiss-cpu==1.7.0
```
